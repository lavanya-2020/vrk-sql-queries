**1) What is the Difference Between Unique and Distinct in SQL ?**

* **Unique** is a constraint in SQL that allows one or more fields or columns of a table to uniquely identify a record in a database table.
* **Distinct** is command used with ‘select’ that helps to return distinct or different values in the result set.

**Usage**
Furthermore, unique is a constraint that prevents two records from having identical values in a column, while distinct helps to remove duplicate values when retrieving data.

**Conclusion**
In brief, SQL is a language that allows performing operations on data stored in the database. Unique and Distinct are two SQL  constraints. The main difference between Unique and Distinct in SQL is that Unique helps to ensure that all the values in a column are different while Distinct helps to remove all the duplicate records when retrieving the records from a table.
